Two new production files have been added as zip archive, ANATHING-BASE_V12s_production.zip and ANATHING-FRONT_V12s_production.zip which offers the board outline on a different layer (BoardOutline.ger). This changes have also changes in the drill hole file (unplated) as the 4 outer holes with 3.2mm for the screws have been changed form board outline (milling) to drill file.
The ANATHING-FRONT has additional to the board outline also all inline millings. It is not able to separate this further by the used software DesignSpark PCB Pro. Your pcb manufacturer should be able to handle this easily, as he knows his processes the best. Usually milling the outline and the inline cuts like big holes for switches, potentiometes and the panelmeter are the same process. If your pcb manufacturer is not able or willing to handle this, you should consider to change to another supplier.
Please note, that the ANATHING-BASE is a standard pcb with 1.6mm thickness and HAL surface while the ANATHING-FRONT is much thicker with 3.0 or 3.2 mm to hold the patch cables and should be produced at least with ENIG surface (gold plated).
